This program is a simple password checker that determines the strength of the password. 
Users are prompted to enter a password and the returns the strength of the password.

Instructions:
    To run this program, you can simply download this file and run on your own machine.
    I used java, and you can use VS code to copy and paste or open this file in your machine.
    You don't need any other dependencies to run this program.

Limitations:
    This program is meant to be strictly for educational purposes. I made this program for my ethics class
    to make a simple security program that tests the strength of the password. 

Ethical consideration:
    Be careful using versions of this code. People could potentially modify it and use it for malicious purposes.
    Be on the lookout for web versions of this app where you have to enter your password. I do not have any hidden code or implementations that steals your password. However, there is obviously a security concern when you'r einputting your password in a random program. 
    Doing this can put your security at risk. However, I do not have any malicious intent and this is purely for educational purposes.
